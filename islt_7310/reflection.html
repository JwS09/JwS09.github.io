        <p> Reflecting on my career and course program experiences so far, I can't help but feel a sense of fulfillment and growth. </p>
        <br>
        <p>My journey as a business major with specializations in marketing, analytics, and information systems at the University of Missouri, Columbia, 
        has been shaped by a variety of involvement experiences from high school, including my active participation in DECA, Speech and Debate, and Student Government.</p> 
            
        <p>These formative experiences laid the foundation for my passion for marketing and data-driven decision-making. Certified in R/Posit, Python, VBA, Microsoft Suite, and SQL, 
        I am further enhancing my skills by pursuing a graduate certificate in Marketing Analytics. As I approach my expected graduation date in May 2024, I eagerly anticipate 
        translating my academic journey into a dynamic professional career.
        </p>
        
        <p>Transitioning from my academic pursuits to the professional landscape, I recognized the power of a professional portfolio website. The decision to create such a 
        platform stemmed from a clear understanding of its benefits. A marketing and data science major can leverage this avenue to spotlight their versatile skill set and practical expertise. 
        By curating an array of projects, campaigns, and analyses, I aim to demonstrate my adeptness to potential employers and collaborators. This virtual space offers an immersive approach to 
        presenting my work, combining visuals, interactive components, and in-depth case studies that go beyond the confines of a conventional resume. Not only does this underscore my technical prowess, 
        but it also highlights my ability to convey intricate ideas effectively. Moreover, a meticulously designed portfolio website contributes to the establishment of a distinct personal brand, 
        allowing me to stand out in a fiercely competitive job market.
        </p>

        <p>Turning to the specific experiences that have enriched my journey, each role has contributed to my multifaceted growth. As an Operations Manager at Peachtree Catering, I honed skills in event logistics, 
        team management, and client relations, handling diverse responsibilities both in the front and back of house. My role as a Marketing Consultant for various clients showcased my ability to adapt and 
        create content across diverse industries, from food-oriented aesthetics to corporate branding. Volunteering as an Office Assistant for the Boy Scouts of America, Great Rivers Council, sharpened my data entry 
        and organizational skills, while also allowing me to engage in community outreach. Finally, my stint as a Data Analyst/SEO Coordinator at DeLine Holdings marked a pivotal step into the data realm, where I worked on
        compiling, organizing, and interpreting complex data sets, as well as delving into the world of search engine optimization.
        </p>

        <p>In retrospect, my experiences have been instrumental in shaping my path as a marketing and data science major. The journey has been characterized by continuous learning, adaptability, and a drive to excel. 
        As I approach the next phase of my career, I am determined to fuse my academic knowledge, practical skills, and personal drive to contribute meaningfully to the field while continuously seeking opportunities for growth and innovation.
