    <h2>DeLine Holdings Marketing Plan and Team Building</h2>
    </div>

    <p>At DeLine Holdings, I had the remarkable opportunity to spearhead a dynamic marketing plan and assemble a proficient team from the ground up. In collaboration with experienced and knowledgeable professionals, we embarked on an exciting journey to enhance the digital presence and marketing strategies of several prominent companies within the DeLine Holdings portfolio, including Alpha Real Estate, District Storage Company, and Belly Market & Rotisserie.</p>

    <h2>Harnessing SEO, Social Media, and Data Analysis</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Our efforts at DeLine Holdings encompassed a comprehensive approach that involved search engine optimization (SEO), social media ad reach, data analysis, and strategic company planning. Our objective was to aggregate and leverage data to gain a competitive advantage, resulting in greater success for the affiliated businesses.</p>

    <br>
    <div class="centered-text">
    <h2>Significant Impact on Brand Awareness and Engagement</h2>
    </div>

    <p>During my internship, the impact was nothing short of extraordinary. We witnessed a substantial boost in the visibility and search engine relevance of the 'Greg Deline' brand. Notably, we achieved an astonishing nearly 4,000% increase in Facebook and Instagram reach and engagement, emphasizing our commitment to driving brand recognition and fostering online engagement.</p>

    <br>

    <div class="centered-text">
    <p>Our focus extended beyond digital marketing, as we also delved into the design, production, and distribution of a wide range of both physical and digital content. This content served various purposes, primarily aimed at community engagement, outreach initiatives, and the creation of informative digital biographies for Loan Officers affiliated with Total Lending Concepts, a subsidiary of DeLine Holdings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="centered-text">
        <p>This journey with DeLine Holdings was marked by a resolute commitment to excellence and a relentless pursuit of innovative strategies to optimize marketing efforts. It was a profound experience that not only sharpened my skills but also contributed significantly to the growth and success of the companies we served. The insights gained from this invaluable experience continue to inform my professional journey and my dedication to achieving outstanding results in the field of marketing and data analysis.</p>
